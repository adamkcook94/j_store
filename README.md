## Features 

### Home 

The home page contains a vibrant background image of a pristine Rolex watch which intends to inform users that the business aims to provide high end luxury products.  

Two buttons are provided in a very structured format so users can easily navigate to either the watch or chain section of the website. Although that option is provided to the user in the navigation bar with “All Watches” and “All Chains” already, the two buttons provide a faster and more direct route to these pages.  

The navigation bar offers a fluid, hover underline effect and also provides visitors with a direct pathway to the products. There is also a crown icon used from “font-awesome” so that users can easily redirect back to the homepage whenever they wish. 

The website uses the two fonts “EB Garamond” and “Playfair Display”. These fonts were chosen as they present a classy theme to the website which interlinks with the website’s business aim of selling luxury products.  

The website also offers search functionality for users to instantly search for a term to find the item they desire. 

### All Items 

The ‘All Items’ section of the website houses all the items listed within the store. The page houses a sort box which offers filtering options: ‘Price’, ‘Brand’, and ‘Name’.  

Items are displayed in a structured format with four items being displayed in each row, with a horizontal rule underneath to separate from other items. Each items image includes basic item information such as their name, price and brand. The display translates well into smaller screen sizes as good spacing is maintained.  

This section was made for users who do not have a specific item in mind and would just like to browse through the store. There is also a back to the top button which allows users to return to the top of the page should they lose their way through the variety of items. 

### Watches and Chains 

The ‘Watches’ and ‘Chains’ section maintains the display structure of the ‘All Items’ section, but also offer a redirection link to the ‘All Items’ page. These pages also offer neat buttons which separate the items into either brands (for Watches) and metals (for Chains).  

### Item Description 

When users click on an item they will be sent to a page which offers a bigger image of the item along with a more detailed description of the item. 

This page gives users the option to make an order for a specific item by giving them a quantity selection button, along with either the ‘Keep Shopping’ or ‘Add to Bag’ buttons. 

Should users click ‘Keep Shopping’ they will be redirected to the items page. Should the user click ‘Add to Bag’, they will receive a confirmation toast which includes item details and an option to go to the checkout page to complete their order. The bag icon in the top right of the screen will also be updated to show the total cost of their order.  

### Bag 

The shopping bag page offers users the ability to update their order by either changing the quantity or removing the item. It also displays product information such as name and price with the order’s grand total. If user’s are satisfied with their order they can click on the ‘Secure Checkout’ button to complete their order. 

### Checkout 

The checkout page includes a form for users to fill out containing their personal, delivery and payment information as well as buttons for users to either adjust their bag or to finalise their order.  

### Checkout Success 

Once users have completed their order, they will be redirected to the ‘Checkout Success’ page where they will also be greeted with a success toast ensuring them that they will be sent a confirmation email as well as their personal order number. 

Also on the checkout success page is the user’s order information, allowing users to make sure they have entered their order details correctly. 

### Register 

The ‘Register’ page contains a sign up form for users to create an account with. This includes mandatory safety checks which make sure the user creates a suitable password. 

Upon successfully creating a suitable account, users will be redirected to an e-mail verification page where users will be prompted to verify their e-mail address, accompanied with an alert toast. 

### Login 

The ‘Login’ page contains a form for registered users to enter their account information to sign in with. For those that do not have an account registered yet, there is an redirect option for users to create an account.  

For registered users who have forgotten their password, there is a button which directs users to the password reset page where they can enter their e-mail address to reset their password. 

### Product Management 

The Product Management page allows the site owner to add new items to the store, by filling out the form. This form includes the item category, name of the product, brand, price, item image and item description. Upon the completion of this form the item will be categorised in either the watches or chains section of the website and be available for purchase.  

### My Profile 

The ‘My Profile’ page contains a registered user’s delivery information which they are able to make changes to, as well as an order history section which gives them proof of their past purchases. 

### Edit Item

The ‘Edit Item' page allows the site owner to access existing items and make the appropriate changes to them.

## Features to Implement in the future 

* As a jewellery store there would need to be a greater variation of products such as rings, earrings etc. 

* In such a competitive industry the business would need to offer greater discounts and deals, so implementing a ‘deals’ section would be a viable addition in the future. 

## Technologies Used 

* HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python programming languages 

* GitHUB – Used as an IDE by the developer. 

* Google Fonts – Used to style the website fonts. 

* Hover.css – Used for an underlining feature in the navigation bar for whenever a user hovers over a page link. 

* Popper.js – Used to reference JavaScript. 

* FontAwesome - Used icons for the arrows, account page and crown icon in the navigation bar.  

* Django – Used to rapidly create a secure and maintainable website. 

* All images imported were downloaded from Google Images and then stored and linked by the developer. 

* BootstrapCDN - Bootstrap 5 was used for the project’s structure and responsiveness. 

* Balsamiq – Used to create wireframes for the website.
